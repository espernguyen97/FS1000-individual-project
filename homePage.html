            <p>My name is Tran Uyen Nhi Nguyen, from Vietnam. I'm currently third-year student in Finance at York University. I always want to challenge myself, discover what I can actually do and see how far I can go. Throughout my university life, I created some eCommerce websites using Wordpress just for fun and it seems that I'm more into creating plugins and building website than doing financial analysis. I decide to choose Fullstack Web Develop course in order to gain more information about how a website is built and maintained and also to see if I should consider going with this path seriously. </p>

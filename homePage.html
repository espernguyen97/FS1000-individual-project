            <p>My name is Tran Uyen Nhi Nguyen. I'm 24 and I'm from Vietnam. I'm currently third-year student in Finance at York University.Finance courses have never been easy for me but I want to challenge myself and learn something practical and that was just my thought in my first year of school. Throughout my university life, I created some eCommerce websites with the help of Wordpress and it seems that I'm more into them, as well as I would like to know more about how developers create, build and maintain a proper website</p>
